Hello!

This is a group project for my machine learning course that I took the lead on.

It contains an analysis of the Hourly-Energy-Consumption-in-The-U.S. by different providers.

Multiple methods were used such as Kmeans, MinMax, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and others, to find patterns in energy production around the United States.
